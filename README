A Python module for generating several subspace clusters. A subspace cluster is a cluster that is clustered along some dimensions, but unclustered in other dimensions. 

This module is included as part of the MolecularFeatureEngineering test suite, but I decided to also included it separately so that it's easier to find for someone who is interested in creating subspace clusters but possibly couldn't find an open source implementation [in Python].
